.SH NAME
driveutility-wipe \- securely wipe a storage device

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B driveutility-wipe
.BI -d " device_path"
.RI [ -p " passes" ]
.RI [ -t " type" ]
.RI [ -z ]
.RI [ -s " size_mb" ]
.RI [ -b " block_size" ]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B driveutility-wipe
is a command-line utility used to securely overwrite a storage device or a specified portion of it with either zeros or random data. This process effectively makes previously stored data unrecoverable. It supports multiple overwrite passes and an optional final zero-fill pass for random wipes. The target device is unmounted before any wiping operation begins.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -d, --device
        Specify the path to the block device to be wiped (e.g.,
        .I /dev/sdb).
        This option is required.

.TP
.B -p, --passes
        Specify the number of overwrite passes to perform. Each pass will overwrite the device with the chosen
        .B --type
        of data. The default is 1 pass.

.TP
.B -t, --type
        Specify the data pattern to use for wiping.
        .B zero
        fills the device with zeros.
        .B random
        fills the device with cryptographically random data. The default is
        .B zero.

.TP
.B -z, --final-zero
        When performing a random wipe (i.e., when
        .B --type random
        is used), this option adds an additional final pass that fills the device with zeros. This makes it less obvious that the device was securely wiped with random data.

.TP
.B -s, --size
        Specify the size in megabytes (MB) of the device to wipe, starting from the beginning. If not specified, the entire device will be wiped.

.TP
.B -b, --block-size
        Specify the block size to be used by the underlying
        .B dd
        command. This affects the performance of the wipe operation. Default is
        .B 1M
        (1 megabyte).

.SH EXIT STATUS
.TP
.B 0
Success. The device was wiped successfully.
.TP
.B 1
General error. This can include the specified path not being a block device, the device not being found, or a failure during the wiping process itself (e.g., `dd` reporting an unexpected error).
.TP
.B 2
Argument parsing error. Invalid or missing command-line arguments.

.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
.B To wipe /dev/sdc with a single pass of zeros:
.B driveutility-wipe -d /dev/sdc -t zero

.TP
.B To perform 3 passes of random data on /dev/sdb, followed by a final zero pass:
.B driveutility-wipe -d /dev/sdb -p 3 -t random -z

.TP
.B To wipe the first 100 MB of /dev/sde with zeros, using a 4M block size:
.B driveutility-wipe -d /dev/sde -s 100 -b 4M
